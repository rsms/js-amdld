# AMD loader

Simple JavaScript [AMD module](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md) loader.

- Uses generators to resolve dependencies quickly and efficiently.
- Provides deterministic module initialization by verifying there are no cyclic dependencies.
- Has no dependencies and is small in size.
- Modules can be loaded gradually and randomly over time with just-in-time initialization as dependencies are resolved.

If you're serving content over HTTP/2, simply `<script src="amdld.min.js"></script>`,
otherwise you'll probably just want to copy-paste the code into your HTML.

The API is very simple:

```ts
define(
  id?           : string,
  dependencies? : string[],
  factory       : (...dependencies :any[])=>void
                | {[key :string] :any}
) : boolean
```

E.g.

```js
define("A", ["B", "C"], function(B, C) {
  console.log(C.hello, B.world);
});
define("B", ["exports"], function(exports) {
  exports.world = 'world';
});
define("C", { hello: 'Hello' });
```

## Random loading

Since AMDLD uses initializeras with pause-and-resumable state, dependencies and modules can be loaded in random order, in synchronous or asynchronous fashion.

Say we have some HTML like this where four modules are loaded concurrently and asynchronously:

```html
<script async src="module_1.js"></script>
<script async src="module_2_and_3.js"></script>
<script async src="module_4.js"></script>
```

Normally, this would require additional app code to track what modules have been loaded and when their dependencies has loaded. But not with AMDLD since dependency resolution is done just-in-time.

For this example, let's say that the files loaded have this content:

```js
// module_1.js
define("mod1", ["mod3"], function (mod3) { console.log('hello from mod1'); });

// module_2_and_3.js
define("mod2", ["mod3"], function (mod3) { console.log('hello from mod2'); });
define("mod3", [],       function () {     console.log('hello from mod3'); });

// module_4.js
define("mod4", ["mod3"], function () { console.log('hello from mod4'); });
```

Now imagine that the following happens in the web browser:

1. Loads HTML document
2. Sends requests for module_1.js, module_2_and_3.js and module_4.js
3. Continues to parse and initialize the rest of the HTML document
4. Receives response for module_4.js and executes the script:
  1. An outstanding dependency on "mod3" means _initialization of "mod4" is suspended._
5. Receives response for module_2_and_3.js and executes the script:
  1. "mod2" begins initialization, but is immediately suspended waiting for "mod3"
  2. "mod3" completes initialization
  3. resumes initialization of "mod4" which completes initialization
  4. resumes initialization of "mod2" which completes initialization
6. Receives response for module_1.js and executes the script:
  1. "mod1" completes initialization

The browser's console looks like this:

```
[09:30:19] hello from mod3
[09:30:19] hello from mod4
[09:30:19] hello from mod2
[09:31:21] hello from mod1
```

What's important to realize here is that "mod4" is initialized _as soon as all it's dependencies are available_, rather than when all modules has loaded. "mod1" therefore is in practice initialized later than "mod4", but since "mod1" doesn't depend on "mod4" (or vice versa), neither have to wait for the other. AMDLD guarantees that the order of initialization is the same every time for each dependency root â€” i.e. "mod3" is _always_ initialized before "mod1" in our example above.

The ["async" test](test/async_test.js) verifies this behavior.

When loading modules over separate files, consider setting `define.timeout` (see API.)


## Deterministic module initialization

Cyclic dependencies cause a lot of issues, primarily by preventing module initialization from being deterministic. AMDLD forces dependencies to be non-cyclical and thus by using AMDLD, all module initialization is deterministic, meaning that when a module's function is executed all it's dependencies have been executed already; any dependant values required during module initialization are guaranteed.

Check this out. Here's an example of a simple program that defines two modules:

```js
define('foo', ['bar'], function(bar) {
  let sum = bar.value * 10;
  console.log(`sum is ${sum}`); // what is printed?
})
define('bar', ['exports'], function(exports) {
  exports.value = 3;
})
```

What is printed to the console? With some module loaders, it depends on when "bar" is defined (imagine loading them over network or from disk where one module might be loaded before the other differs from time to time.)

In this case AMDLD suspends initialization of `foo` until `bar` has fully initialized, meaning that no matter when what module is loaded, the result is always the same (prints `sum is 30` to the console.)

When a cyclic dependency is detected, a short but descriptive error is thrown:

```js
define("main", ["bar"], function (bar) {});
define("bar", ["baz"], function (baz) {});
define("baz", ["main"], function () {});
// Error: Cyclic module dependency: baz -> main -> bar -> baz
```

The ["cyclic3" test](test/cyclic3_test.js) verifies this behavior.


## API

```ts
define(
  id? :string,
  dependencies? :string[],
  factory :(...dependencies :any[])=>void | {[key :string] :any}
) : boolean
  // Define a module. Returns true if the module was initialized immediately,
  // otherwise false is returned to indicate that initialization is suspended
  // waiting for a dependency.
  // See https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md for details.

define.timeout : number
  // Set to a number larger than zero to enable timeout.
  // Whenever define() is called, the timeout is reset.
  // When the timer expires an error is thrown if there are still undefined modules.

define.require(id :string) : any
  // Acquire a module's exported API. Throws an error if the module is not defined.
  // Might return undefined if the module has not yet been initialized.
```


## Building and testing

To build the minified version, make sure you have [`closure-compiler`](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) in your `$PATH` and:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will take `amdld.js` as input and write an optimized and ES5-compatible version to `amdld.min.js` and `amdld.min.js.map`.

To run unit tests, simply:

```
$ npm test
[basic @amdld.js] ... OK
[basic @amdld.min.js] ... OK
[cyclic1 @amdld.js] ... OK
...
```

Note: Building and testing requires [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed, but is not required for using AMDLD in a web browser.
